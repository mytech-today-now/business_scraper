## üöÄ Deployment

### Development Deployment

#### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

#### Start Production Server
```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

### Application Redeployment

When you need to stop, recompile, and redeploy the application (e.g., after code changes or updates):

#### Complete Redeployment Process
```bash
# 1. Stop any running applications
# Check for running processes on port 3000
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
# Kill any Node.js processes if needed
tasklist | findstr node

# 2. Clean build artifacts and dependencies
rm -rf .next                    # Remove Next.js build cache
rm -rf node_modules             # Remove dependencies
rm -f package-lock.json         # Remove lock file

# 3. Fresh dependency installation
npm install                     # Reinstall all dependencies

# 4. Clean rebuild
npm run build                   # Build for production

# 5. Start production server
npm start                       # Start the application
```

#### Quick Redeployment (without dependency reinstall)
```bash
# For minor changes when dependencies haven't changed
rm -rf .next                    # Clean build cache
npm run build                   # Rebuild application
npm start                       # Start production server
```

#### Verification Steps
```bash
# Check if application is running
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Test application accessibility
curl http://localhost:3000

# Run concurrent search tests (optional)
npm test -- src/lib/__tests__/searchOrchestrator.concurrent.test.ts
```

#### Troubleshooting Redeployment
```bash
# If port 3000 is still in use
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9   # Force kill processes on port 3000

# If build fails due to cache issues
npm run build -- --no-cache     # Build without cache

# If dependencies have conflicts
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

> **Note**: The complete redeployment process ensures a clean environment and is recommended after major updates or when troubleshooting deployment issues.
