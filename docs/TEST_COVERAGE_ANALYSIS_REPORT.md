## Test Infrastructure Issues

### Failing Test Suites
1. **Performance Tests**: Browser pool load tests failing with timeout issues
2. **Security Tests**: Payment security middleware tests failing due to mock configuration
3. **Integration Tests**: CSRF authentication tests failing with import errors
4. **Hook Tests**: useSearchStreaming tests failing with connection errors

### Missing Test Categories
- [ ] Unit tests for core business logic
- [ ] Integration tests for API workflows  
- [ ] End-to-end user journey tests
- [ ] Security penetration tests
- [ ] Performance and load tests
- [ ] Error handling and edge case tests
- [ ] Accessibility tests
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility tests
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness tests
- [ ] Data validation tests
- [ ] Compliance audit tests
- [ ] Disaster recovery tests

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Payment Processing**: Zero test coverage on financial transactions
2. **Authentication System**: Minimal coverage on user security
3. **Data Integrity**: No validation testing for business data
4. **API Security**: No testing for injection attacks or authorization
5. **Session Management**: No testing for session hijacking prevention

### Business Impact
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Potential for data breaches and financial loss
- **Compliance Violations**: GDPR, PCI-DSS, and other regulatory risks
- **Production Failures**: High probability of runtime errors
- **Data Loss**: Risk of corrupted or lost business data
- **User Experience**: Poor reliability and performance
