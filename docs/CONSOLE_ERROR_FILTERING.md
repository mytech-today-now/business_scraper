# Console Error Filtering for DuckDuckGo Scraping

## Problem

When scraping DuckDuckGo search results, the browser console was filled with non-critical errors and warnings that made debugging difficult and created noise in logs:

```
Error with Permissions-Policy header: Unrecognized feature: 'interest-cohort'.
useTranslation: DISMISS is not available
Failed to load resource: net::ERR_FAILED
The resource was preloaded using link preload but not used within a few seconds
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
```

## Solution

Implemented a comprehensive console filtering and resource blocking system that:

1. **Filters Console Messages**: Automatically filters out non-critical browser warnings and errors
2. **Blocks Problematic Resources**: Prevents loading of resources that cause console errors
3. **Maintains Critical Error Logging**: Still logs genuine application errors
4. **Improves Performance**: Reduces network requests and browser overhead

## Implementation

### 1. Console Filter Utilities (`src/lib/consoleFilterUtils.ts`)

Created a reusable utility that provides:

- **Predefined Filter Patterns**: Common console noise patterns for different scenarios
- **Configurable Filter Levels**: `strict`, `moderate`, `minimal` filtering options
- **Resource Blocking**: Intelligent blocking of problematic resources
- **Clean Scraping Setup**: One-line setup for noise-free scraping

### 2. Enhanced DuckDuckGo Scraper (`src/lib/enhancedDuckDuckGoScraper.ts`)

A specialized scraper with:

- **Built-in Console Filtering**: Automatically filters DuckDuckGo-specific noise
- **Enhanced Resource Blocking**: Blocks resources that cause console errors
- **Retry Logic**: Robust error handling with retry mechanisms
- **Performance Optimization**: Faster scraping with reduced resource loading

### 3. Updated API Route (`src/app/api/search/route.ts`)

Enhanced the existing DuckDuckGo API route with:

- **Integrated Console Filtering**: Uses the new filtering utilities
- **Reduced Console Noise**: Filters out the specific errors you were seeing
- **Maintained Functionality**: All existing features preserved

## Usage

### Basic Console Filtering

```typescript
import { setupCleanScraping } from '@/lib/consoleFilterUtils'

// Apply to any Puppeteer page
await setupCleanScraping(page, {
  consoleFilter: {
    filterLevel: 'moderate',
    logCriticalErrors: true,
    logPageErrors: true
  },
  resourceBlocking: 'moderate'
})
```

### Custom Filtering

```typescript
import { applyConsoleFiltering } from '@/lib/consoleFilterUtils'

await applyConsoleFiltering(page, {
  filterLevel: 'strict',
  logCriticalErrors: true,
  logPageErrors: true,
  customFilters: [
    'your-specific-error-pattern',
    'another-pattern-to-filter'
  ]
})
```

### Enhanced DuckDuckGo Scraper

```typescript
import { EnhancedDuckDuckGoScraper } from '@/lib/enhancedDuckDuckGoScraper'

const scraper = new EnhancedDuckDuckGoScraper()
await scraper.initialize()

const results = await scraper.scrapeResults({
  query: 'charter schools near me',
  page: 0,
  maxResults: 10,
  blockResources: true,
  filterConsole: true
})
```

## Filter Levels

### Strict
- Filters almost all console noise
- Blocks most non-essential resources
- Best for production scraping

### Moderate (Recommended)
- Filters common noise patterns
- Allows some warnings through
- Good balance of filtering and visibility

### Minimal
- Only filters obvious noise
- Preserves most console output
- Good for debugging

## Filtered Patterns

### DuckDuckGo Specific
- `useTranslation: DISMISS is not available`
- `expanded-maps-vertical` resource errors
- `duckassist-ia` resource errors
- `wpm.` JavaScript/CSS loading errors

### Browser Policy Warnings
- `Permissions-Policy header: Unrecognized feature`
- `interest-cohort` warnings
- `browsing-topics` warnings

### Resource Loading Errors
- `Failed to load resource`
- `net::ERR_FAILED`
- `favicon` and `.ico` errors
- `mapkit` and `apple-mapkit` errors

### Preload Warnings
- `was preloaded using link preload but not used`
- Link preload timing warnings

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Logs**: Console output is now focused on actual issues
2. **Better Performance**: Fewer resources loaded means faster scraping
3. **Easier Debugging**: Real errors are no longer hidden in noise
4. **Reusable**: Can be applied to other scraping scenarios
5. **Configurable**: Different filter levels for different needs

## Testing

Run the console filter tests:

```bash
npm test src/__tests__/lib/consoleFilterUtils.test.ts
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add more site-specific filter patterns
- Implement machine learning-based noise detection
- Add metrics for filtered vs. critical messages
- Create browser extension for manual testing

## Notes

- The filtering is conservative - it errs on the side of showing errors rather than hiding them
- Critical application errors are never filtered
- The system can be disabled by setting filter level to `minimal` or removing the setup call
- All filtered messages are still available in browser dev tools if needed for debugging
