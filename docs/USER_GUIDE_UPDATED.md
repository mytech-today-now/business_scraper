- Verify only your custom industry is selected
- Review console logs to confirm correct keywords are being used

#### Search Taking Too Long
**Symptoms**: Searches running for 30+ minutes
**Solutions**:

- Check internet connection stability

- Restart browser between large searches
- Close other browser tabs during searches

### Getting Help
1. **Check Console Logs**: Browser developer tools (F12) show detailed information
2. **Review Processing Steps**: Application shows real-time progress and errors
3. **Test with Smaller Datasets**: Reduce scope to isolate issues
4. **Clear Application Data**: Reset to default state if needed

## üìà Best Practices

2. **Use Populated Areas**: ZIP codes in business districts yield more results
