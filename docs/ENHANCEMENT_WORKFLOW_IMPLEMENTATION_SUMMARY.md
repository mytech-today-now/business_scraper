   - Mock data generation

7. **Analysis Tool** (`scripts/run-enhancement-analysis.js`)
   - Quick console log analysis
   - Pattern detection preview
   - Recommendation generation

### üìä Analysis Results from Actual Console Logs

The workflow successfully analyzed the existing `console_log_context.txt` file and identified:

#### Detected Patterns
- **Streaming Connection Issues**: 18 occurrences
  - Component: `useSearchStreaming`, `stream-search API`
  - Priority: High
  - Recommendation: Implement exponential backoff, connection pooling, and better error handling

- **Excessive ZIP Code Logging**: 68 occurrences
  - Component: `AddressInputHandler`
  - Priority: Medium
  - Recommendation: Implement debounced logging or reduce log frequency for repeated inputs

- **Memory Monitoring**: 6 occurrences
  - Component: `Monitoring`
  - Status: Active monitoring detected

#### Log Statistics
- Total log entries: 224
- INFO logs: 85
- WARN logs: 18
- ERROR logs: 0
- DEBUG logs: 12

### üîß Features Implemented

#### Console Log Analysis
- **Multi-level Log Parsing**: Supports INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG levels
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring issues and anomalies
- **Component Mapping**: Links log messages to specific code components
- **Recommendation Engine**: Generates actionable improvement suggestions

#### GitHub Integration
- **Automated Issue Creation**: Creates detailed issues with log excerpts
- **Issue Updates**: Adds test results and implementation details
- **Auto-closure**: Closes issues when enhancements are complete
- **Proper Labeling**: Applies appropriate labels and assignees

#### Test Automation
- **Smart File Detection**: Uses git diff and pattern-based detection
- **Test Discovery**: Automatically finds corresponding test files
- **Multi-format Support**: Handles .js, .ts, .tsx files
- **Result Aggregation**: Collects and reports test outcomes

#### Workflow Orchestration
- **Step-by-step Execution**: Clear workflow progression
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure recovery
- **Logging**: Comprehensive operation logging
- **Artifact Generation**: Creates detailed reports and outputs

### üì¶ Package.json Scripts Added

```json
{
  "workflow:enhancement": "node scripts/console-log-enhancement-workflow.js",
  "workflow:enhancement:help": "node scripts/console-log-enhancement-workflow.js --help",

  "workflow:enhancement:test": "jest src/__tests__/scripts/enhancement-workflow.test.js",
  "workflow:enhancement:analyze": "node scripts/run-enhancement-analysis.js"
}
```

### üéØ Usage Examples

#### Quick Analysis
```bash
npm run workflow:enhancement:analyze
```

#### Full Workflow Execution
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"
npm run workflow:enhancement
```

#### Demo Mode
