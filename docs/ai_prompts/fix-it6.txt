Implement the following enhancement to the application.  Do the enhancement first.  Follow the Rules and Guidelines for the project.  Plan out you actions.  Work logically through the process.  Be sure to cover all of the instances where the enhancement alters the application.  Handle errors and fallback to seamless solutions.
Log each fix/enhancement as an Issue/Error on Github for the project with the required proper 'bug' documentation.
Be sure the Issue has the proper Assignees, Labels, bug, Something isn't working, critical, etc for the Issue.
If the changes are code related make sure the test cases run to 98% success.  After the resolution of the Issue, close the Issue on GitHub with the proper documentation.
enhancement:
Test Environment Configuration and CI/CD Validation
MEDIUM PRIORITY
Configure test environment for proper ESM module handling and validate CI/CD pipeline enforcement.

CONTEXT:
- Final phase of TypeScript error resolution (GitHub Issue #233)
- Current test success rate: <50% (target: 98%)
- Need to validate quality gates and CI/CD enforcement
- Complete the critical security enhancement

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:

TEST ENVIRONMENT FIXES:
1. Configure Jest for proper ESM module handling (lucide-react imports)
2. Fix crypto API polyfills for test environment (crypto.createHash, crypto.randomUUID)
3. Resolve CSRF token functionality in tests
4. Fix environment variable handling in test configuration
5. Ensure all tests pass with TypeScript strict mode

CI/CD PIPELINE VALIDATION:
1. Verify GitHub Actions properly enforce TypeScript quality gates
2. Ensure pre-commit hooks prevent type errors
3. Validate deployment process blocks on TypeScript errors
4. Test build process fails correctly with type errors
5. Confirm ESLint integration works properly

JEST CONFIGURATION UPDATES:
- Add proper ESM module transformation
- Configure crypto API mocks/polyfills
- Fix moduleNameMapper for @/ path aliases
- Update test environment setup
- Add proper TypeScript Jest configuration

APPROACH:
1. Update jest.config.js for ESM and crypto compatibility
2. Add necessary polyfills and mocks for Node.js APIs
3. Fix CSRF token test functionality
4. Validate CI/CD pipeline configuration
5. Run full test suite to achieve 98% success rate
6. Verify build process properly blocks on errors

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- All tests pass (98%+ success rate)
- Jest handles ESM modules correctly
- Crypto API works in test environment
- CSRF functionality tests properly
- CI/CD pipeline enforces quality gates
- Build process blocks on TypeScript errors
- GitHub Issue #233 can be closed

FINAL VALIDATION:
- npm run build (should fail with remaining errors)
- npm test (should achieve 98%+ success)
- npm run type-check (should show error count)
- Verify CI/CD pipeline enforcement

Close GitHub Issue #233 with comprehensive documentation upon completion.
