"3.1 Multi-User & Collaboration

ðŸ‘¥ Team Management

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Define granular user roles (Admin, Manager, Analyst, Contributor, Viewer) with TypeScript-based type safety, ensuring secure access to sensitive scraping configurations, enrichment pipelines, and analytics data.

Team Workspaces & Shared Projects: Enable dedicated workspaces within the Next.js application where teams can collaboratively build scraping campaigns, manage keyword strategies, and share validated datasets.

Collaborative Lead Management: Allow multiple users to simultaneously contribute to lead curation pipelines, with React-driven real-time updates (via websockets or Next.js API routes) and conflict resolution mechanisms.

Activity Tracking & Audit Logs: Maintain an immutable history of scraping jobs, keyword adjustments, enrichment actions, and user decisions, stored with structured metadata for compliance and accountability.

ðŸ“Š Advanced Analytics Dashboard

Real-Time Scraping Performance Metrics: Visualize Puppeteer job execution time, request throughput, error rates, and completion status, displayed in React charts with WebSocket-driven live updates.

Data Quality Analytics & Trends: Monitor enrichment accuracy, duplicate detection effectiveness, and keyword-to-result success ratios, powered by TypeScript-validated schemas and backend aggregation pipelines.

User Activity & Productivity Insights: Generate insights into team performanceâ€”such as number of validated leads, enrichment accuracy per user, and average turnaround timeâ€”presented in role-specific dashboards.

ROI Tracking & Reporting: Quantify the business value of scraping campaigns by correlating enriched lead outcomes with downstream KPIs (conversion rates, contact accuracy, engagement lift), exportable to CSV, PDF, or business intelligence tools."
