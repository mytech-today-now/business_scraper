Implement the following enhancement to the application.  Do the enhancement first.  Follow the Rules and Guidelines for the project.  Plan out you actions.  Work logically through the process.  Be sure to cover all of the instances where the enhancement alters the application.  Handle errors and fallback to seamless solutions.
Log each fix/enhancement as an Issue/Error on Github for the project with the required proper 'bug' documentation.
Be sure the Issue has the proper Assignees, Labels, bug, Something isn't working, critical, etc for the Issue.
If the changes are code related make sure the test cases run to 98% success.  After the resolution of the Issue, close the Issue on GitHub with the proper documentation.

Proceed to Payment System Testing
Priority: MEDIUM - Begin comprehensive payment security testing after authentication completion
Detailed Augment AI Prompt:
Implement comprehensive testing for the payment system components to achieve 100% coverage with security focus, following the successful authentication testing patterns.

Payment components to test:
1. src/app/api/payment/ - Payment API routes (subscription, billing-portal, history, plans)
2. src/controller/paymentController.ts - Payment workflow management
3. src/model/stripeService.ts - Stripe integration and payment processing
4. src/model/userPaymentService.ts - User-payment integration
5. src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts - Stripe webhook handling

Security testing priorities:
- Payment fraud prevention
- Webhook signature validation  
- PCI compliance validation
- Subscription tampering prevention
- Price manipulation protection
- Payment data sanitization
- Stripe integration security
- Webhook replay attack prevention

Test categories for each component:
- Unit tests for payment functions (95%+ coverage)
- Integration tests for payment flows
- Security tests for fraud scenarios
- Performance tests under payment load
- Webhook security and validation tests
- Stripe API integration tests
- Error handling and edge cases
- PCI compliance validation

Requirements:
- Follow authentication testing patterns and infrastructure
- Use proper Jest mocking for Stripe API calls
- Ensure test isolation and cleanup
- Validate all payment security measures
- Test subscription lifecycle management
- Verify webhook signature validation
- Achieve 98%+ test success rate
- Document payment security vulnerabilities

Create comprehensive test files:
- src/__tests__/api/payment/payment-routes.comprehensive.test.ts
- src/__tests__/controller/paymentController.comprehensive.test.ts
- src/__tests__/model/stripeService.comprehensive.test.ts
- src/__tests__/model/userPaymentService.comprehensive.test.ts
- src/__tests__/api/webhooks/stripe-webhook.comprehensive.test.ts
- src/__tests__/security/payment-security-comprehensive.test.ts

Log all payment security issues as GitHub Issues with proper documentation and close them after resolution.
Payment System Components Status:
❌ Payment API Routes - Subscription, billing, history endpoints
❌ Payment Controller - Workflow and feature access management
❌ Stripe Service - Payment processing and customer management
❌ User Payment Service - User-payment integration
❌ Stripe Webhooks - Secure webhook processing
