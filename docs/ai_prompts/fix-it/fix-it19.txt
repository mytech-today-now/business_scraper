Fix Browser Pool Mocking
Fix the browser pool mocking issues in the business_scraper test suite. I need you to:

1. Analyze the current browser pool implementation in src/lib/browserPool.ts
2. Review and fix the browser pool mocking in src/__tests__/mocks/optimized-browser-pool.mock.ts
3. Resolve browser pool load test failures (currently 32% success rate vs 80% target)
4. Fix Puppeteer and browser-related test failures
5. Improve test isolation for browser pool operations

Key issues to address:
- "No available browser capacity" errors in tests
- Browser pool memory leak detection
- Proper cleanup of browser instances in tests
- Mock reliability for concurrent browser operations
- Performance test failures related to browser pool

Ensure the browser pool mocking:
- Properly simulates browser acquisition and release
- Handles concurrent requests reliably
- Provides consistent performance metrics
- Cleans up resources properly after tests
- Supports the expected load testing scenarios

The goal is to achieve >80% success rate in browser pool load tests.
