Custom Hooks & Context Testing

                
Hooks & Context Testing PromptCopy

Implement comprehensive tests for custom hooks and context providers in the business_scraper application. I need you to:

1. Create test suites for all custom hooks in src/hooks/
2. Test React context providers in src/controller/
3. Cover hook lifecycle, state management, and side effects
4. Test context value propagation and consumer behavior
5. Achieve 90%+ coverage for all hooks and context providers

Priority hooks and contexts to test:
- src/hooks/useSearchStreaming.ts - Search streaming functionality
- src/hooks/useCSRFProtection.ts - CSRF protection hook
- src/hooks/usePerformanceMonitoring.ts - Performance monitoring
- src/controller/ConfigContext.tsx - Application configuration context
- src/controller/PerformanceContext.tsx - Performance tracking context

For each hook/context, test:
- Initial state and default values
- State updates and side effects
- Error handling and cleanup
- Integration with external services
- Performance characteristics and optimization

Use React Testing Library's renderHook utility and proper mocking for external dependencies.
