Implement the following enhancement to the application.  Do the enhancement first.  Follow the Rules and Guidelines for the project.  Plan out you actions.  Work logically through the process.  Be sure to cover all of the instances where the enhancement alters the application.  Handle errors and fallback to seamless solutions.
Log each fix/enhancement as an Issue/Error on Github for the project with the required proper 'bug' documentation.
Be sure the Issue has the proper Assignees, Labels, bug, Something isn't working, critical, etc for the Issue.
If the changes are code related make sure the test cases run to 98% success.  After the resolution of the Issue, close the Issue on GitHub with the proper documentation.

Continue with Auth Component Testing
Priority: HIGH - Achieve 100% coverage across all authentication modules
Detailed Augment AI Prompt:
Implement comprehensive testing for the remaining authentication components to achieve 100% coverage with security focus.

Components to test:
1. src/lib/auth.ts - NextAuth configuration, user verification, session management
2. src/lib/auth-middleware.ts - Authentication middleware, session validation, IP binding
3. src/hooks/useCSRFProtection.ts - CSRF token management, validation, refresh
4. src/lib/jwt-session-service.ts - JWT token creation, validation, renewal

For each component, create comprehensive test suites covering:
- Unit tests for individual functions (95%+ coverage)
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Security tests for vulnerability scenarios
- Performance tests under load conditions
- Error handling and edge cases

Test categories required:
- Authentication bypass prevention
- Session security (hijacking, fixation, timeout)
- Token security (JWT, CSRF, refresh tokens)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and brute force protection
- Audit logging and security events
- Multi-user authentication flows
- OAuth integration security

Requirements:
- Follow existing test patterns from auth-security-comprehensive.test.ts
- Use proper Jest mocking strategies (avoid previous mocking issues)
- Ensure test isolation and cleanup
- Validate security measures thoroughly
- Achieve 98%+ test success rate
- Document any security vulnerabilities discovered

Create separate test files for each component following the naming convention:
- src/__tests__/lib/auth.comprehensive.test.ts
- src/__tests__/lib/auth-middleware.comprehensive.test.ts  
- src/__tests__/hooks/useCSRFProtection.comprehensive.test.ts
- src/__tests__/lib/jwt-session-service.comprehensive.test.ts
Authentication Components Status:
❌ src/lib/auth.ts - NextAuth configuration testing
❌ src/lib/auth-middleware.ts - Middleware security testing
❌ src/hooks/useCSRFProtection.ts - CSRF protection testing
❌ src/lib/jwt-session-service.ts - JWT service testing
