Achieve 100% Authentication Coverage
Detailed Augment AI Prompt:
Execute comprehensive validation to ensure 100% authentication system coverage and security compliance.

Validation requirements:
1. Run complete test suite with coverage reporting
2. Verify all authentication components achieve 95%+ line coverage
3. Validate all security scenarios are tested
4. Ensure 98%+ test success rate across all authentication tests
5. Generate comprehensive test reports

Coverage targets:
- Authentication API routes: 100% coverage
- Authentication libraries: 95%+ coverage  
- Security utilities: 100% coverage
- CSRF protection: 100% coverage
- Session management: 100% coverage
- JWT services: 95%+ coverage

Security validation checklist:
- ✅ SQL injection prevention tested
- ✅ XSS protection validated
- ✅ Session hijacking prevention verified
- ✅ Brute force protection tested
- ✅ CSRF attack prevention validated
- ✅ Rate limiting security tested
- ✅ Information disclosure prevention verified
- ✅ Timing attack prevention tested
- ✅ Audit trail security validated

Commands to execute:
npm test -- src/__tests__/api/auth/ --coverage --verbose
npm test -- src/__tests__/lib/auth* --coverage --verbose  
npm test -- src/__tests__/hooks/useCSRFProtection* --coverage --verbose
npm test -- src/__tests__/security/ --coverage --verbose

Generate final authentication testing report documenting:
- Total test count and success rate
- Coverage percentages by component
- Security vulnerabilities identified and resolved
- Performance benchmarks
- Recommendations for production deployment
