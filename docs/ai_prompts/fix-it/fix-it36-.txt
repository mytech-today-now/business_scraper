React Component Testing

                
React Component Testing PromptCopy

Implement comprehensive React component tests for the business_scraper application. I need you to:

1. Create test suites for all React components in src/components/ and src/view/
2. Use React Testing Library for user-centric testing approaches
3. Test component rendering, user interactions, and state management
4. Cover accessibility requirements and responsive design behavior
5. Achieve 85%+ coverage for all UI components

Priority components to test:
- src/view/components/App.tsx - Main application component
- src/view/components/ResultsTable.tsx - Data display components
- src/components/payments/ - Payment-related UI components
- src/view/components/dashboard/ - Dashboard and analytics components
- src/components/security/ - Security-related UI components

For each component, test:
- Rendering with various props and state combinations
- User interactions (clicks, form submissions, keyboard navigation)
- Error states and loading conditions
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Responsive behavior and mobile compatibility

Use proper mocking for external dependencies and ensure all user workflows are thoroughly tested.
