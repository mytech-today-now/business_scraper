Service Integration Testing
Implement comprehensive service integration testing for business_scraper. I need you to:

1. Test integration between internal services and modules
2. Validate external service integrations (APIs, databases)
3. Test data flow between different system components
4. Implement end-to-end workflow testing
5. Achieve 95% coverage for service integration scenarios

Integration areas to test:
- Database service integration
- External API service integration (geocoding, business data)
- File storage service integration
- Email service integration
- Cache service integration
- Search engine integration
- Analytics service integration

Test scenarios:
- Service-to-service communication
- Data consistency across services
- Error propagation and handling
- Service failure recovery
- Transaction management
- Async operation handling
- Service dependency management

Create integration test suites for:
- Database operations and transactions
- External API calls and responses
- File upload and storage workflows
- Email notification systems
- Cache invalidation and updates
- Search indexing and retrieval

Mock external services appropriately while testing real integration logic.
