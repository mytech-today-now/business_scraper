Log each fix/enhancement as an Issue/Error on Github for the project with the required proper 'bug' documentation.
Be sure the Issue has the proper Assignees, Labels, bug, Something isn't working, critical, etc for the Issue.
If the changes are code related make sure the test cases run to 98% success.  After the resolution of the Issue, close the Issue on GitHub with the proper documentation.

Business Logic Testing

Implement comprehensive tests for the business logic and service layer of the business_scraper application. I need you to:

1. Create test suites for all service files in src/lib/ and src/model/
2. Test data processing, validation, and transformation logic
3. Cover external service integrations with proper mocking
4. Implement comprehensive error handling and edge case testing
5. Achieve 85%+ coverage for all business logic modules

Priority modules to test:
- src/model/scraperService.ts - Web scraping business logic
- src/model/searchEngine.ts - Search engine integration
- src/lib/database.ts - Database operations and queries
- src/lib/cache.ts - Caching mechanisms
- src/lib/validation-middleware.ts - Data validation logic

For each module, test:
- Core business logic with various input scenarios
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Performance characteristics and optimization
- Data integrity and validation rules
- Integration with external services and APIs

Use comprehensive mocking strategies for external dependencies and ensure all business rules are thoroughly validated.
