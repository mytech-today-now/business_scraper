Complete Authentication Security Tests
Priority: HIGH - Fix remaining 7 failing tests to achieve 100% authentication security coverage
Detailed Augment AI Prompt:
Fix the remaining 7 failing authentication security tests in src/__tests__/security/auth-security-comprehensive.test.ts to align with the actual implementation behavior. 

Current test status:
- ❌ Session Hijacking Prevention (0/2 tests) - sessionId format mismatch
- ❌ Information Disclosure Prevention (1/2 tests) - mock expectation issues  
- ❌ Password Security (1/2 tests) - error response format mismatch
- ❌ Security Headers and Cookies (0/1 tests) - mock call expectations
- ❌ Audit Trail Security (0/2 tests) - audit service integration

Specific issues to resolve:
1. Session ID masking: Tests expect '[SESSION_ACTIVE]' and '[SESSION_CREATED]' but actual auth route may return different format
2. Missing response variable in session creation test (line 265)
3. Mock function expectations that don't match actual auth route implementation
4. Audit service calls that may not be triggered as expected

Requirements:
- Examine src/app/api/auth/route.ts actual implementation
- Update test expectations to match real behavior
- Ensure all security scenarios are properly validated
- Maintain 98%+ test success rate
- Document any discovered security gaps

Follow the Rules and Guidelines for the project. Test each fix individually and ensure no regressions in passing tests.
