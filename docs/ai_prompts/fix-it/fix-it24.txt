API Endpoint Testing
Implement comprehensive testing for all API endpoints in business_scraper. I need you to:

1. Create complete test coverage for all routes in src/app/api/
2. Test request/response validation for each endpoint
3. Implement error handling scenario testing
4. Test API middleware and security measures
5. Achieve 95% coverage for all API endpoints

API endpoints to test comprehensively:
- /api/auth/* - Authentication endpoints
- /api/businesses/* - Business data endpoints  
- /api/scrape/* - Web scraping endpoints
- /api/search/* - Search functionality
- /api/export/* - Data export endpoints
- /api/analytics/* - Analytics endpoints
- /api/health/* - Health check endpoints
- /api/upload/* - File upload endpoints

Test scenarios for each endpoint:
- Valid request handling
- Invalid request validation
- Authentication/authorization checks
- Rate limiting enforcement
- Input sanitization
- Output validation
- Error response formatting
- HTTP status code accuracy

Integration testing:
- Database operations
- External service calls
- File system operations
- Cache interactions
- Background job triggering

Performance testing:
- Response time validation
- Concurrent request handling
- Large payload processing
- Memory usage monitoring

Create comprehensive test suites that validate all API functionality and ensure robust error handling.
