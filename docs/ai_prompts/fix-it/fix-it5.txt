Implement the following enhancement to the application.  Do the enhancement first.  Follow the Rules and Guidelines for the project.  Plan out you actions.  Work logically through the process.  Be sure to cover all of the instances where the enhancement alters the application.  Handle errors and fallback to seamless solutions.
Log each fix/enhancement as an Issue/Error on Github for the project with the required proper 'bug' documentation.
Be sure the Issue has the proper Assignees, Labels, bug, Something isn't working, critical, etc for the Issue.
If the changes are code related make sure the test cases run to 98% success.  After the resolution of the Issue, close the Issue on GitHub with the proper documentation.

Address Remaining Array Access Safety Issues
Issue: TypeScript strict mode with noUncheckedIndexedAccess requires null checks before accessing array elements. Many test files still have unsafe array access patterns causing "Object is possibly undefined" errors.
CopyContinue fixing unsafe array access patterns across all test files using the established expectArrayElement helper. SPECIFIC TASKS: 1. Search for all "Object is possibly undefined" errors related to array access 2. Replace unsafe array[index] patterns with expectArrayElement(array, index) 3. Add proper null checks for array operations 4. Use safe array access patterns consistently ESTABLISHED PATTERN TO USE: - Import { expectArrayElement } from '../utils/mockTypeHelpers' - Replace: expect(array[0].property) with: expect(expectArrayElement(array, 0).property) - For multiple accesses: const firstItem = expectArrayElement(array, 0) SEARCH FOR THESE PATTERNS: - Direct array access: array[0], array[1], etc. - Array property access: array[0].property - Array method calls: array[0].method() - Loop array access: array[i] in for loops EXAMPLE REPLACEMENT: // Before: expect(logs.logs[0].id).not.toBe(logs.logs[1].id) // After: const firstLog = expectArrayElement(logs.logs, 0) const secondLog = expectArrayElement(logs.logs, 1) expect(firstLog.id).not.toBe(secondLog.id) PRIORITY FILES TO FIX: - src/__tests__/compliance/complianceReporting.test.ts - src/__tests__/compliance/dataRetention.test.ts - src/__tests__/compliance/gdprService.test.ts - src/__tests__/hooks/useOfflineSupport.test.ts SUCCESS CRITERIA: - All array access uses safe patterns with null checks - No "Object is possibly undefined" errors for array access - Consistent use of expectArrayElement helper - Improved type safety across test files Reference the patterns in src/__tests__/compliance/auditService.test.ts for examples of proper array access safety.
✅ Expected Outcome: All array access is type-safe, no undefined object errors, consistent safety patterns.
