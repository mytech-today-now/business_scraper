Implement the following enhancement to the application.  Do the enhancement first.  Follow the Rules and Guidelines for the project.  Plan out you actions.  Work logically through the process.  Be sure to cover all of the instances where the enhancement alters the application.  Handle errors and fallback to seamless solutions.
Log each fix/enhancement as an Issue/Error on Github for the project with the required proper 'bug' documentation.
Be sure the Issue has the proper Assignees, Labels, bug, Something isn't working, critical, etc for the Issue.
If the changes are code related make sure the test cases run to 98% success.  After the resolution of the Issue, close the Issue on GitHub with the proper documentation.

Performance Baseline Establishment
Establish comprehensive performance baselines and testing for business_scraper. I need you to:

1. Implement performance testing for critical user journeys
2. Establish baseline metrics for key operations
3. Create load testing scenarios
4. Implement performance regression testing
5. Set up automated performance monitoring

Performance testing areas:
- Page load times and rendering performance
- API response times under various loads
- Database query performance
- Search functionality performance
- Data export performance
- File upload performance
- Real-time feature performance

Load testing scenarios:
- Concurrent user simulation
- High-volume data processing
- Peak traffic simulation
- Stress testing for breaking points
- Endurance testing for memory leaks

Performance metrics to track:
- Response times (p50, p95, p99)
- Throughput (requests per second)
- Memory usage and garbage collection
- CPU utilization
- Database connection pooling
- Cache hit rates
- Error rates under load

Create performance test suites:
- Unit performance tests for critical functions
- Integration performance tests for workflows
- Load tests for scalability validation
- Stress tests for reliability validation
- Endurance tests for stability validation

Establish performance budgets and alerts for regression detection.
