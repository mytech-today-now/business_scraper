Payment Processing Tests

                
Payment Security Testing PromptCopy

Implement comprehensive payment processing tests for the business_scraper application. I need you to:

1. Complete the test implementation in src/__tests__/critical/payment-processing.test.ts
2. Test all Stripe integration flows including payment intent creation, webhook handling, and subscription management
3. Cover payment security scenarios including data sanitization, rate limiting, and fraud prevention
4. Implement comprehensive error handling tests for payment failures and network issues
5. Ensure 100% coverage for all payment-related modules

Focus on testing:
- src/model/stripeService.ts - Stripe service integration
- src/controller/paymentController.ts - Payment flow control
- src/app/api/payments/ - Payment API endpoints
- src/middleware/paymentSecurity.ts - Payment security middleware
- Webhook signature validation and event processing

Use Stripe test mode and proper mocking for external API calls. Include tests for payment failures, network timeouts, invalid webhooks, and security attack scenarios.
