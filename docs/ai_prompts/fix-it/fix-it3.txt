Implement the following enhancement to the application.  Do the enhancement first.  Follow the Rules and Guidelines for the project.  Plan out you actions.  Work logically through the process.  Be sure to cover all of the instances where the enhancement alters the application.  Handle errors and fallback to seamless solutions.
Log each fix/enhancement as an Issue/Error on Github for the project with the required proper 'bug' documentation.
Be sure the Issue has the proper Assignees, Labels, bug, Something isn't working, critical, etc for the Issue.
If the changes are code related make sure the test cases run to 98% success.  After the resolution of the Issue, close the Issue on GitHub with the proper documentation.

Fix Missing Module Declarations
Issue: Components like @/components/ClientOnlyStripeProvider, @/components/ServiceWorkerRegistration, and @/components/DebugSystemInitializer are missing proper TypeScript declarations, causing "Cannot find module" errors.
CopyFix missing TypeScript module declarations for components that are causing "Cannot find module" errors in test files. SPECIFIC TASKS: 1. Identify all components with missing module declarations by searching for TS2307 errors 2. For each missing component, either: - Create proper TypeScript declaration files (.d.ts) - Add the components to the existing module declarations - Create the missing component files if they should exist PRIORITY COMPONENTS TO FIX: - @/components/ClientOnlyStripeProvider - @/components/ServiceWorkerRegistration - @/components/DebugSystemInitializer APPROACH: 1. Search codebase for existing patterns of module declarations 2. Use consistent typing patterns established in our mock helpers 3. Ensure all declarations follow the project's TypeScript configuration SUCCESS CRITERIA: - All TS2307 "Cannot find module" errors resolved - Test files compile without module declaration errors - Components have proper TypeScript support - No regression in existing functionality Follow the patterns established in src/__tests__/utils/mockTypeHelpers.ts for consistent typing.
✅ Expected Outcome: All "Cannot find module" errors resolved, improved IntelliSense support for components.
