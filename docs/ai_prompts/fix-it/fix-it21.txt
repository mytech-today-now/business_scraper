Objective: Achieve 100% coverage for authentication and payment modules

5. Authentication System Testing
Implement comprehensive testing for the authentication system in business_scraper. I need you to:

1. Create complete test coverage for src/app/api/auth route handlers
2. Test src/lib/auth.ts authentication functions thoroughly
3. Implement security testing for src/lib/auth-middleware.ts
4. Test CSRF protection in src/hooks/useCSRFProtection.ts
5. Achieve 100% coverage for all authentication-related modules

Test scenarios to implement:
- User login/logout workflows
- Session management and validation
- Password hashing and verification
- Token generation and validation
- Authentication middleware functionality
- CSRF token generation and validation
- Rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Security headers and cookie settings

Security test cases:
- Invalid credentials handling
- Session hijacking prevention
- Brute force attack protection
- SQL injection prevention in auth queries
- XSS prevention in auth responses
- Proper error message handling (no information leakage)

Create tests for:
- Unit tests for individual auth functions
- Integration tests for complete auth flows
- Security tests for vulnerability scenarios
- Performance tests for auth under load

Ensure all authentication security measures are thoroughly tested and validated.
