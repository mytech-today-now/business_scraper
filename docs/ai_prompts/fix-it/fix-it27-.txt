React Component Testing
Implement comprehensive React component testing for business_scraper. I need you to:

1. Create complete test coverage for all React components in src/components/
2. Test custom hooks in src/hooks/
3. Implement user interaction testing
4. Test component state management and props
5. Achieve 90% coverage for UI components

Component testing areas:
- Form components and validation
- Data display components (tables, cards, lists)
- Navigation and routing components
- Modal and dialog components
- Search and filter components
- Dashboard and analytics components
- File upload components

Test scenarios for each component:
- Rendering with different props
- User interaction handling (clicks, inputs, selections)
- State changes and updates
- Error state handling
- Loading state management
- Responsive behavior
- Accessibility features

Custom hooks testing:
- Hook state management
- Effect handling and cleanup
- Custom logic validation
- Error handling in hooks
- Performance optimization

Testing patterns to implement:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Snapshot testing for UI consistency
- User event simulation
- Mock external dependencies

Use React Testing Library best practices for user-centric testing.
