Resolve Test Timeout Issues
Resolve test timeout issues in the business_scraper application. I need you to:

1. Analyze failing tests that exceed timeout limits (currently many tests timing out)
2. Identify performance bottlenecks in test execution
3. Optimize test performance by improving mocking strategies
4. Adjust timeout configurations appropriately for different test types
5. Implement proper test cleanup to prevent hanging processes

Specific areas to address:
- Browser pool load tests failing due to timeouts
- Performance tests exceeding 30-second limits
- Memory-intensive operations causing delays
- Streaming connection tests hanging
- Integration tests with external service calls

Configure appropriate timeouts:
- Unit tests: 5-10 seconds
- Integration tests: 15-30 seconds  
- Performance tests: 60-120 seconds
- E2E tests: 180 seconds

Ensure all tests complete within reasonable time limits while maintaining reliability.
