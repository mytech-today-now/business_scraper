Performance & Load Testing

                
Performance Testing PromptCopy

Implement comprehensive performance and load testing for the business_scraper application. I need you to:

1. Create performance test suites using Jest and custom performance utilities
2. Test API response times under various load conditions
3. Implement memory leak detection and monitoring tests
4. Test browser pool performance and resource management
5. Create stress tests for critical user workflows

Focus on testing:
- API endpoint response times and throughput
- Database query performance and optimization
- Memory usage patterns and leak detection
- Browser pool efficiency and resource cleanup
- Large dataset processing performance

Performance targets:
- API responses < 200ms for 95% of requests
- Memory usage stable under sustained load
- Browser pool cleanup within 30 seconds
- Search operations complete within 5 seconds
- Export operations handle 10,000+ records efficiently

Use performance monitoring tools and establish baseline metrics for regression testing.
