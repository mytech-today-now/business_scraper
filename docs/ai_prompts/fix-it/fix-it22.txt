Payment Processing Testing
Implement comprehensive testing for payment processing in business_scraper. I need you to:

1. Create complete test coverage for src/app/api/payments route handlers
2. Test src/controller/paymentController.ts payment logic thoroughly
3. Implement testing for Stripe webhook handling in src/app/api/webhooks/stripe
4. Test payment security and validation measures
5. Achieve 100% coverage for all payment-related modules

Payment test scenarios:
- Payment intent creation and confirmation
- Subscription management workflows
- Billing portal access
- Payment history retrieval
- Stripe webhook event processing
- Payment failure handling
- Refund processing
- Currency and amount validation

Security test cases:
- Payment data sanitization
- Stripe signature validation
- PCI compliance measures
- Payment amount validation
- Unauthorized payment prevention
- Payment method security
- Webhook replay attack prevention

Integration tests:
- End-to-end payment flows
- Stripe API integration testing
- Database payment record validation
- Email notification testing
- Error recovery scenarios

Mock Stripe services properly:
- Payment intents
- Webhooks
- Customer objects
- Subscription objects
- Error responses

Ensure all payment processing is secure, reliable, and thoroughly tested.
