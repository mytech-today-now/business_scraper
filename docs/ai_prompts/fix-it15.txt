Test Coverage Gap Analysis
Prompt:
Perform a comprehensive test coverage analysis to identify gaps and achieve 98% coverage target. Please: 1. Run coverage analysis on the entire codebase 2. Identify files and functions with low or missing coverage 3. Prioritize critical business logic and user-facing features 4. Create a coverage improvement plan with specific targets 5. Generate detailed coverage reports by module/component 6. Identify untested edge cases and error scenarios Focus on critical paths: authentication, data processing, API routes, and user interactions.
