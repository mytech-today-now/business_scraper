"### **2.2 Automated Workflows**

- **‚ö° Smart Automation Engine**
  - **Scheduled Scraping with Intelligent Timing**  
    - Implement dynamic cron-based scheduling in **Next.js API routes** with **TypeScript** for fine-grained job orchestration.  
    - Integrate Puppeteer-based scraping pipelines that adaptively adjust crawl frequency based on site update patterns, data criticality, and freshness scoring.  
    - Leverage queue management (e.g., BullMQ or custom job queues) for distributed execution and error recovery.

  - **Automatic Data Refresh and Updates**  
    - Deploy serverless functions or long-running workers in **Next.js backend** to trigger Puppeteer scraping sessions at configurable intervals.  
    - Automatically enrich previously discovered business entities with **updated contact information, addresses, and metadata**.  
    - Cache intermediate results in Redis/Postgres with intelligent TTL (time-to-live) to prevent redundant queries.

  - **Duplicate Detection Across Time Periods**  
    - Use **TypeScript validation schemas** to normalize scraped business records.  
    - Detect entity duplication across historical runs by comparing identifiers (email, phone, domain, business registration IDs).  
    - Persist deduplication logic in a **Postgres/Prisma ORM pipeline**, ensuring versioned business records and historical audit trails.

  - **Data Aging and Freshness Tracking**  
    - Embed freshness indicators on every business entity, tracking **‚Äúlast verified date‚Äù**.  
    - Flag stale or outdated contact data using heuristic decay models.  
    - Surface alerts in the React dashboard when critical data requires re-scraping or manual review.

---

- **üîÑ Continuous Data Monitoring**
  - **Website Change Detection**  
    - Integrate Puppeteer DOM snapshot comparisons to detect structural and content changes over time.  
    - Use hashing algorithms and diff-checking utilities in TypeScript to identify meaningful changes vs. noise.  
    - Surface differences in the React dashboard for analyst review.

  - **Contact Information Updates**  
    - Monitor business websites and linked directories for **phone/email/address updates**.  
    - Apply **pattern-matching, NLP-based entity extraction**, and AI-driven validation pipelines to confirm accuracy.  
    - Automatically push updates to the central business intelligence layer for real-time enrichment.

  - **Business Status Monitoring (Active/Inactive)**  
    - Scrape and validate business registry pages, Google Maps listings, and review sites to track closure or rebranding events.  
    - Automatically mark businesses as inactive in the data store with status change history.  
    - Provide **Next.js API endpoints** to query active/inactive status for integrations.

  - **Competitive Intelligence Tracking**  
    - Continuously monitor competitor domains, service offerings, pricing structures, and marketing content via Puppeteer crawls.  
    - Enrich competitor profiles with metadata (traffic trends, keyword rankings, partnerships).  
    - Expose **React dashboard visualizations** with charts, timelines, and intelligence summaries for business analysts.
