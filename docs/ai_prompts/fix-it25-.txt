Business Rule Validation Testing
Implement comprehensive testing for business logic validation in business_scraper. I need you to:

1. Test all business rules in src/model/ and src/controller/ directories
2. Validate data processing workflows and transformations
3. Test business logic constraints and validations
4. Implement edge case and boundary testing
5. Achieve 95% coverage for core business logic

Business logic areas to test:
- Data validation rules for business information
- Search algorithm logic and ranking
- Data enrichment and processing workflows
- Export format generation and validation
- Analytics calculation logic
- Subscription and billing business rules
- User permission and access control logic

Test scenarios:
- Valid data processing workflows
- Invalid data handling and error recovery
- Boundary conditions and edge cases
- Business rule constraint enforcement
- Data transformation accuracy
- Calculation logic verification
- Workflow state management

Create comprehensive test suites for:
- Data model validation
- Business process workflows
- Calculation and algorithm logic
- State management and transitions
- Error handling and recovery

Ensure all business rules are properly tested and validated.
