Core API Routes Testing

                
API Routes Testing PromptCopy

Implement comprehensive tests for all API routes in the business_scraper application. I need you to:

1. Create test suites for all API endpoints in src/app/api/
2. Test all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for each endpoint
3. Cover request validation, response formatting, and error handling
4. Implement integration tests that verify end-to-end API workflows
5. Achieve 90%+ coverage for all API route files

Priority API routes to test:
- src/app/api/businesses/ - Business data management
- src/app/api/search/ - Search functionality
- src/app/api/scraping/ - Web scraping operations
- src/app/api/analytics/ - Analytics and reporting
- src/app/api/export/ - Data export functionality

For each endpoint, test:
- Valid request scenarios with proper authentication
- Invalid input handling and error responses
- Rate limiting and security controls
- Database operations and data integrity
- External service integrations with proper mocking

Use Next.js API testing patterns and ensure all tests are isolated and deterministic.
