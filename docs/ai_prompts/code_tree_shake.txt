Implement the following enhancement to the application.  Do the enhancement first.  Follow the Rules and Guidelines for the project.  Plan out you actions.  Work logically through the process.  Be sure to cover all of the instances where the enhancement alters the application.  Handle errors and fallback to seamless solutions.

Log this enhancement as an Issue/Error on Github for the project with the required proper 'bug' documentation.
Be sure the Issue has the proper Assignees, Labels, bug, Something isn't working, critical, csp, security, Projects, Milestone, Relationships, Development, Notifications, Participants, etc for the Issue.

Provide a solution that is a seemless experience for the user.  If the changes are code related make sure the test cases run to 90% success.  After the resolution of the Issue, close the Issue on GitHub with the proper documentation.

Optimize the business scraper application's bundle size through comprehensive tree shaking, focusing on large AI/ML libraries and unused dependencies. Target a 30-50% bundle size reduction while maintaining all functionality.

Context Analysis
This Next.js application uses several heavy libraries:

TensorFlow.js (~50MB) - Currently using barrel import import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs'
Natural (~3MB) - NLP library with specific usage patterns
Compromise (~2MB) - Text analysis with specific method usage
D3 (~3MB) - Listed in dependencies but appears unused
Lighthouse - Website analysis tool
Simple-statistics - Statistical calculations
Primary Tasks
1. Optimize TensorFlow.js Imports
Current Problem: src/lib/aiService.ts uses barrel import:
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs'
Action Required:

Replace with specific imports based on actual usage in:
src/lib/aiService.ts
src/lib/aiLeadScoring.ts
src/lib/predictiveAnalyticsEngine.ts
Analyze which TensorFlow functions are actually used (likely: sequential, layers.dense, tensor2d, train.adam)
Update to specific imports like:
import { sequential, layers, tensor2d, train } from '@tensorflow/tfjs'
2. Optimize Natural.js Imports
Current Usage: src/lib/websiteQualityAnalyzer.ts uses:
import natural from 'natural'
// Uses: natural.SentenceTokenizer, natural.WordTokenizer
Action Required:

Replace barrel import with specific tokenizer imports:
import { SentenceTokenizer, WordTokenizer } from 'natural'
3. Optimize Compromise.js Imports
Current Usage: src/lib/websiteQualityAnalyzer.ts uses:
import compromise from 'compromise'
// Uses: compromise(content).nouns().out('array'), .verbs().out('array')
Action Required:

Investigate if compromise supports specific imports for nouns/verbs functionality
If not, document as optimized (compromise may not support tree shaking)
4. Audit and Remove Unused Dependencies
Critical Investigation:

D3 Library: Listed in package.json as "d3": "^7.9.0" but no imports found in codebase
Sentiment Library: Listed in changelog but no actual usage found
ML-Matrix: Listed in dependencies but no imports found
Action Required:

Verify D3 is completely unused and remove from package.json
Check for any dynamic imports or indirect usage
Remove other unused AI/ML libraries if confirmed unused
5. Enhance Next.js Bundle Optimization
Current Config: next.config.js has:
optimizePackageImports: ['lucide-react']
Action Required:

Expand to include all heavy libraries:
experimental: {
  optimizePackageImports: [
    'lucide-react',
    '@tensorflow/tfjs',
    'natural',
    'compromise',
    'simple-statistics',
    'lighthouse'
  ],
}
6. Implement Dynamic Imports for AI Features
Current Problem: AI libraries loaded on every page load

Action Required:

Convert AI service imports to dynamic imports in components:
src/view/components/LeadScoreBadge.tsx (already partially done)
src/app/api/ai/insights/route.ts
Other AI-related components
Use code splitting for AI dashboard features
7. Update Test Mocks
Current Issue: Tests mock entire TensorFlow library

Action Required:

Update test mocks in:
src/__tests__/ai/aiService.test.ts
src/__tests__/integration/ai-workflow.test.ts
src/__tests__/lib/aiLeadScoring.test.ts
Ensure mocks align with new specific imports
Implementation Priority
High Impact: TensorFlow.js optimization (largest bundle reduction)
Medium Impact: Remove unused dependencies (D3, sentiment, ml-matrix)
Medium Impact: Natural.js and Compromise.js optimization
Low Impact: Enhanced Next.js configuration
Future: Dynamic imports for AI features
Validation Requirements
Run npm run analyze to measure bundle size before/after
Ensure all AI features continue working:
Lead scoring functionality
Website quality analysis
Predictive analytics
Business intelligence features
Verify all tests pass with updated imports
Test production build deployment
Expected Outcomes
Bundle Size: 30-50% reduction (primarily from TensorFlow.js optimization)
Performance: Faster initial page loads, improved Core Web Vitals
Maintainability: Cleaner imports, removed unused dependencies
Functionality: Zero breaking changes to existing features
Files to Modify
src/lib/aiService.ts
src/lib/websiteQualityAnalyzer.ts
src/lib/aiLeadScoring.ts (if exists)
src/lib/predictiveAnalyticsEngine.ts
package.json (remove unused deps)
next.config.js (enhance optimization)
Test files with TensorFlow mocks
Post-Implementation
Document new import patterns in README
Update AI features documentation
Create bundle analysis report
Set up monitoring for future bundle size regressions
Execute this optimization systematically, testing each change before proceeding to the next. Focus on TensorFlow.js first as it will provide the largest immediate impact.
