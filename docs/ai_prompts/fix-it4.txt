Implement the following enhancement to the application.  Do the enhancement first.  Follow the Rules and Guidelines for the project.  Plan out you actions.  Work logically through the process.  Be sure to cover all of the instances where the enhancement alters the application.  Handle errors and fallback to seamless solutions.
Log each fix/enhancement as an Issue/Error on Github for the project with the required proper 'bug' documentation.
Be sure the Issue has the proper Assignees, Labels, bug, Something isn't working, critical, etc for the Issue.
If the changes are code related make sure the test cases run to 98% success.  After the resolution of the Issue, close the Issue on GitHub with the proper documentation.

Fix Incomplete Response Objects in Test Files
Issue: Many test files create incomplete Response objects missing required properties like headers, redirected, status, statusText, type, url, body, bodyUsed, and methods like json(), text(), blob(), etc.
CopySystematically fix all incomplete Response objects in test files using the established mock patterns. SPECIFIC TASKS: 1. Search for all incomplete Response object mocks across test files 2. Replace them with proper createMockResponse() calls 3. Use mockFetchResponses patterns for common scenarios 4. Ensure all Response objects have required properties and methods ESTABLISHED PATTERNS TO USE: - Import { createMockResponse, mockFetchResponses } from '../utils/commonMocks' - Use mockFetchResponses.success(data) for 200 responses - Use mockFetchResponses.serverError(error) for 500 responses - Use createMockResponse(data, init) for custom responses SEARCH FOR THESE PATTERNS: - Incomplete Response objects: { ok: true, json: async () => ... } - Missing properties: headers, redirected, status, statusText, type, url - Missing methods: json(), text(), blob(), arrayBuffer(), formData(), clone() EXAMPLE REPLACEMENT: // Before: const mockResponse = { ok: true, json: async () => ({ data: 'test' }) } as Response // After: const mockResponse = mockFetchResponses.success({ data: 'test' }) SUCCESS CRITERIA: - All Response objects have complete required properties - No TypeScript errors related to missing Response properties - Consistent use of established mock patterns - All fetch mocks use proper Response typing Reference the patterns in src/__tests__/utils/commonMocks.ts and src/__tests__/hooks/useCSRFProtection.test.tsx for examples.
✅ Expected Outcome: All Response objects properly typed, no missing property errors, consistent mock patterns.
