# Professional Code Review Prompt for Business Scraper Application
# Date: 2025-09-25
# Target: Augment AI in VS Code
# Purpose: Comprehensive GitHub-style code review at enterprise standards

## MISSION
Perform a comprehensive, professional-grade code review of the Business Scraper Application codebase that meets the standards expected at Google, Amazon, or Microsoft. This review should be conducted as if preparing a detailed GitHub code review with actionable feedback, security assessments, and improvement recommendations.

## REVIEW SCOPE & METHODOLOGY

### 1. ARCHITECTURE & CODE ORGANIZATION REVIEW
- **Layered Architecture Analysis**: Evaluate the separation of concerns between data/logic layer (models), presentation layer (views), control layer (controllers), services, and utilities
- **File Structure Assessment**: Review naming conventions, directory organization, and module boundaries
- **Dependency Management**: Analyze package.json dependencies, version pinning, and security vulnerabilities
- **TypeScript Implementation**: Assess type safety, strict mode usage, and type definitions quality

### 2. SECURITY VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Review NextAuth implementation, session management, and access controls
- **Input Validation**: Examine all user inputs, API endpoints, and data sanitization
- **CSRF Protection**: Validate CSRF token implementation and protection mechanisms
- **CSP (Content Security Policy)**: Review CSP configuration and XSS prevention
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Analyze database queries and parameterization
- **Secrets Management**: Check for exposed credentials, proper environment variable usage
- **Rate Limiting**: Evaluate API rate limiting and DDoS protection
- **Data Encryption**: Review encryption at rest and in transit
- **Compliance Framework**: Assess GDPR, CCPA, and SOC 2 compliance implementation

### 3. PERFORMANCE & SCALABILITY ANALYSIS
- **Database Performance**: Review query optimization, indexing strategies, and connection pooling
- **Caching Strategy**: Evaluate Redis implementation, cache invalidation, and performance gains
- **Memory Management**: Analyze memory leaks, garbage collection, and resource cleanup
- **API Performance**: Review response times, pagination, and bulk operations
- **Frontend Performance**: Assess bundle size, code splitting, and rendering optimization
- **Concurrent Processing**: Evaluate multi-threading, async operations, and race conditions

### 4. TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE EVALUATION
- **Test Coverage Analysis**: Review unit, integration, e2e, security, performance, and accessibility test coverage
- **Test Quality Assessment**: Evaluate test design, mocking strategies, and assertion quality
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Review automated testing, build processes, and deployment validation
- **BVT (Build Verification Tests)**: Assess health checks and smoke tests
- **Security Testing**: Review penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and compliance testing

### 5. CODE QUALITY & MAINTAINABILITY
- **Code Readability**: Assess naming conventions, code comments, and documentation quality
- **Error Handling**: Review exception handling, logging, and error recovery mechanisms
- **Code Duplication**: Identify repeated code patterns and refactoring opportunities
- **Design Patterns**: Evaluate use of appropriate design patterns and architectural decisions
- **Technical Debt**: Identify areas requiring refactoring or modernization

## SPECIFIC AREAS OF FOCUS

### Frontend (React/Next.js)
- Component architecture and reusability
- State management and data flow
- Performance optimization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG standards)
- SEO optimization and meta tag management

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- API design and RESTful principles
- Middleware implementation and security
- Database integration and ORM usage
- Background job processing and scheduling
- Microservices architecture considerations

### Infrastructure & DevOps
- Docker configuration and multi-stage builds
- Environment configuration management
- Monitoring and logging implementation
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Scalability and load balancing strategies

### Data Management
- Database schema design and normalization
- Data migration strategies
- Backup and retention policies
- Data privacy and anonymization
- Analytics and reporting capabilities

## REVIEW OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

### 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Provide a high-level assessment of the codebase quality, security posture, and overall architecture health.

### 2. CRITICAL ISSUES (P0)
List any security vulnerabilities, data integrity risks, or system stability issues that require immediate attention.

### 3. HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES (P1)
Identify performance bottlenecks, scalability concerns, or significant technical debt that should be addressed soon.

### 4. MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES (P2)
Note code quality improvements, refactoring opportunities, and maintainability enhancements.

### 5. LOW PRIORITY ISSUES (P3)
Suggest minor optimizations, documentation improvements, and nice-to-have enhancements.

### 6. POSITIVE OBSERVATIONS
Highlight well-implemented features, good architectural decisions, and exemplary code quality areas.

### 7. RECOMMENDATIONS
Provide specific, actionable recommendations for each identified issue with:
- Clear problem description
- Impact assessment
- Proposed solution
- Implementation effort estimate
- Priority justification

## REVIEW STANDARDS & CRITERIA

### Code Quality Metrics
- Maintainability Index: Target >70
- Cyclomatic Complexity: Target <10 per function
- Test Coverage: Target >95% across all test categories
- Security Score: Target 100% (no high/critical vulnerabilities)
- Performance Score: Target >90 (Lighthouse/Core Web Vitals)

### Security Standards
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Zero tolerance for exposed secrets
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Input validation and output encoding
- Secure communication protocols

### Performance Benchmarks
- API response time: <200ms for 95th percentile
- Page load time: <3 seconds
- Memory usage: Stable with no leaks
- Database query performance: <100ms average

## DELIVERABLE FORMAT
Structure the review as a GitHub issue with:
- Clear title indicating review scope
- Detailed description with findings
- Labeled sections for each priority level
- Actionable tasks with checkboxes
- Code snippets and file references where applicable
- Links to relevant documentation or standards

## EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS
1. Begin with a comprehensive codebase scan using available tools
2. Analyze each component systematically according to the review criteria
3. Document findings with specific file references and line numbers
4. Prioritize issues based on security, performance, and business impact
