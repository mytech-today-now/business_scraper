Date: 2025-09-23
Priority: High
Category: Testing Infrastructure & API Logic
Related Issue: Follow-up to NextRequest Mocking Fix (Issue #197)

Problem Summary
===============
Following the successful resolution of NextRequest mocking inconsistencies, the test suite still has failures related to API handler logic and dependency mocking. The BVT tests show 5/10 passing, with remaining failures in API response logic, health check endpoints, and service dependency mocking.

Current Test Status
==================
✅ NextRequest mocking: 100% resolved
❌ API handler logic: Multiple failures
❌ Dependency mocking: Inconsistent behavior
❌ Service integration: Health checks failing
❌ Response formatting: Unexpected status codes

Specific Issues to Address
==========================

1. **API Response Logic Failures**:
   - BVT-001: Expected status 302 (redirect) but getting different response
   - BVT-002: Expected status 200 but getting 500 (internal server error)
   - BVT-004: Response data structure not matching expected format
   - BVT-005: Expected status 503 but getting 200
   - BVT-006: Expected status 500 but getting 503

2. **Dependency Mocking Issues**:
   - streamingSearchService mock not behaving as expected
   - advancedRateLimitService mock configuration problems
   - Health check service dependencies not properly mocked

3. **Service Integration Problems**:
   - Health check endpoint returning unexpected data structures
   - Streaming service fallback logic not working as expected
   - Rate limiting service integration issues

Task Requirements
=================
Fix the API handler logic and dependency mocking issues to achieve 99.9% test success rate across the BVT test suite. The solution should maintain compatibility with existing functionality and follow all project rules and guidelines.

Implementation Steps
====================

Step 1: Analyze API Handler Logic
---------------------------------
1. **Examine API Route Handlers**:
   - Review `src/app/api/stream-search/route.ts` for expected behavior
   - Review `src/app/api/health/route.ts` for response format
   - Identify discrepancies between expected and actual responses

2. **Trace Request Flow**:
   - Follow the request processing pipeline
   - Identify where responses are being modified
   - Check error handling and fallback mechanisms

Step 2: Fix Dependency Mocking
------------------------------
1. **Standardize Service Mocks**:
   - Create comprehensive mocks for streamingSearchService
   - Ensure advancedRateLimitService mock returns expected structure
   - Mock all external dependencies consistently

2. **Update Mock Configurations**:
   ```typescript
   // Example: Proper streamingSearchService mock
   jest.mock('@/lib/streamingSearchService', () => ({
     streamingSearchService: {
       healthCheck: jest.fn(),
       processStreamingSearch: jest.fn(),
       // Add all required methods
     }
   }))
   ```

Step 3: Fix API Handler Response Logic
-------------------------------------
1. **Health Check Endpoint** (`src/app/api/health/route.ts`):
   - Ensure response format matches test expectations
   - Fix status code logic for different health states
   - Verify service dependency checks

2. **Stream Search Endpoint** (`src/app/api/stream-search/route.ts`):
   - Fix fallback redirect logic (should return 302 when service unavailable)
   - Ensure streaming response returns correct content-type
   - Verify error handling returns appropriate status codes

Step 4: Update Test Expectations
--------------------------------
1. **Review Test Assertions**:
   - Verify test expectations match actual API behavior
   - Update assertions if API behavior is correct but tests are wrong
   - Ensure test scenarios reflect real-world usage

2. **Mock Data Consistency**:
   - Ensure mock responses match production data structures
   - Verify mock service behaviors align with actual service contracts

Step 5: Add Comprehensive Error Handling
----------------------------------------
1. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - Implement proper fallback mechanisms
   - Ensure services fail gracefully when dependencies are unavailable
   - Add proper error logging and monitoring

2. **Status Code Consistency**:
   - Standardize HTTP status code usage across endpoints
   - Ensure error responses include proper error messages
   - Implement consistent response format

Files to Examine and Modify
===========================

**Primary API Files**:
- `src/app/api/stream-search/route.ts` - Streaming search endpoint
- `src/app/api/health/route.ts` - Health check endpoint
- `src/lib/streamingSearchService.ts` - Core streaming service
- `src/lib/advancedRateLimit.ts` - Rate limiting service

**Test Files**:
- `src/tests/bvt/streaming-service-bvt.test.ts` - BVT test suite
- `src/__tests__/api/` - API-specific tests
- Mock configurations in test setup files

**Supporting Files**:
- `src/utils/apiErrorHandling.ts` - Error handling utilities
- `src/lib/error-handling.ts` - Error handling middleware
- Service configuration and initialization files

Testing Requirements
====================

1. **BVT Test Success**: Achieve 99.9% success rate on BVT test suite
2. **API Integration Tests**: Ensure all API endpoints work correctly
3. **Error Scenario Testing**: Verify proper error handling and fallbacks
4. **Service Dependency Tests**: Test service interactions and mocking
5. **Regression Testing**: Ensure no breaking changes to existing functionality

Success Criteria
=================

- [ ] All BVT tests pass (10/10 tests passing)
- [ ] API endpoints return expected status codes and response formats
- [ ] Service dependencies are properly mocked and behave consistently
- [ ] Error handling works correctly for all failure scenarios
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns proper service status information
- [ ] Streaming endpoint properly handles service availability/unavailability
- [ ] Rate limiting integration works as expected
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

Implementation Guidelines
=========================

1. **Follow Project Rules**: Adhere to all rules in `.augment/rules/2025-08-19_AugmentAIRulesUserGuidelines.md`
2. **Maintain Test Coverage**: Ensure 95%+ test coverage is maintained
3. **Document Changes**: Update documentation for any API behavior changes
4. **Version Control**: Use proper commit messages following conventional commit format
5. **Error Logging**: Log any errors as GitHub Issues with proper documentation
6. **Code Quality**: Run linting and type checking before committing changes

Additional Considerations
========================

1. **Service Architecture**: Ensure proper separation of concerns between services
2. **Configuration Management**: Verify environment-specific configurations
3. **Performance Impact**: Monitor any performance implications of changes
4. **Security**: Ensure error responses don't leak sensitive information
5. **Monitoring**: Add appropriate logging and monitoring for debugging

Expected Outcome
================

After completion, the test suite should achieve 99.9% success rate with:
- All API endpoints functioning correctly
- Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Consistent service dependency mocking
- Reliable health check and streaming functionality
- No breaking changes to existing features

This enhancement should result in a robust, well-tested API layer that supports reliable development and deployment workflows.
