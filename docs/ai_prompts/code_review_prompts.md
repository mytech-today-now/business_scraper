   - src/hooks/useMemoryLeakDetection.ts â†’ src/hooks/useMemoryLeakDetection.tsx
   - src/__tests__/utils/testHelpers.ts â†’ src/__tests__/utils/testHelpers.tsx

2. Update all import statements that reference these files to use the new .tsx extensions

3. Verify that tsconfig.json properly handles JSX compilation for these files

4. Run TypeScript compilation to ensure no errors remain

5. Update any build scripts or configuration files that reference the old file names

Ensure the application builds successfully after these changes.

2. Fix all type errors that arise from enabling strict mode
3. Add proper type annotations where implicit any types are detected
4. Ensure null/undefined checks are properly handled
5. Fix any issues with function parameter types and return types
6. Update any @ts-ignore comments to @ts-expect-error where appropriate
7. Verify the application compiles and runs correctly with strict mode enabled

Document any significant type changes made during this process.
```

2. Configure Web Crypto API polyfills for Edge Runtime compatibility
3. Update test configuration to properly handle crypto APIs
4. Fix any failing tests related to crypto API usage
5. Ensure authentication tests pass with proper crypto API support
6. Add fallback implementations for environments that don't support native crypto APIs

Test thoroughly to ensure crypto functionality works across all environments.
```

## ðŸŸ  HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

```
Systematically fix all failing test suites in the Business Scraper application:

1. Fix useSearchStreaming connection error tests (8/9 failing)
2. Fix CSRF token validation tests (6/12 failing)  
3. Fix security monitoring tests (9/9 failing)
4. Fix authentication tests failing due to crypto API issues
5. Update test environment configuration to resolve compatibility issues
6. Ensure all test utilities and helpers are properly configured
7. Run the complete test suite and verify >95% pass rate

Provide detailed analysis of what was causing each test failure and how it was resolved.
```

### Prompt 6: Resolve ESLint Violations
```
Fix all ESLint violations in the Business Scraper application:

1. Replace all @ts-ignore comments with @ts-expect-error where appropriate
2. Replace all instances of 'var' with 'let' or 'const' as appropriate
3. Fix parsing errors in TypeScript files
4. Ensure consistent code formatting and style
5. Update ESLint configuration if needed to match project standards
6. Run ESLint with --fix flag to automatically resolve fixable issues
7. Manually address any remaining violations

Ensure the codebase passes all ESLint checks without warnings or errors.
```

### Prompt 7: Optimize Build Configuration
```
Optimize the build configuration for the Business Scraper application:

1. Review and update webpack configuration for optimal performance
2. Ensure proper JSX configuration for all TypeScript files
