Fix Sensitive Data Exposure
P0 - Critical Security Data Protection
Files: src/app/api/*/route.ts

Issue: Sensitive data exposed in API responses and error messages

Impact: Information disclosure, potential data breach

Copy Augment AI Prompt
Fix sensitive data exposure across API endpoints:

1. Implement data sanitization for all API responses
2. Remove sensitive information from error messages
3. Add response filtering to exclude internal data
4. Implement proper error handling without information leakage
5. Add data classification and protection controls

Files requiring immediate attention:
- src/app/api/users/route.ts: Remove password hashes from responses
- src/app/api/scraping/route.ts: Sanitize internal configuration data
- src/app/api/auth/route.ts: Remove session details from error responses
- src/app/api/data-management/route.ts: Filter sensitive business data

Security measures to implement:
- Create response sanitization middleware
- Implement field-level data classification
- Add error message sanitization
- Remove stack traces from production responses

Data protection requirements:
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Implement data masking for logs
- Add PII detection and redaction
- Ensure GDPR compliance for data handling

Testing requirements:
- Test API responses for sensitive data leakage
- Verify error message sanitization
- Test data filtering across all endpoints
- Validate encryption implementation
