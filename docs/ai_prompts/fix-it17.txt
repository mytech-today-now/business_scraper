enhancement:

Resolve infrastructure issues preventing test execution

1. Fix CORS/JSDOM Configuration
Fix the CORS and JSDOM configuration issues in the business_scraper test environment. I need you to:

1. Analyze the current Jest setup in jest.setup.js and identify CORS-related configuration issues
2. Fix the JSDOM configuration to properly handle localhost requests during testing
3. Update the test environment to prevent "Cross origin http://localhost forbidden" errors
4. Ensure XMLHttpRequest mocking works correctly for API testing
5. Test the fixes by running a sample API test to verify CORS issues are resolved

Focus on:
- Configuring JSDOM to allow cross-origin requests for localhost
- Updating fetch and XMLHttpRequest mocking
- Ensuring proper test isolation for API calls
- Validating that existing tests can make HTTP requests without CORS errors

The goal is to eliminate all CORS-related test failures and enable proper API testing.
