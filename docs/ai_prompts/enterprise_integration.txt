"3.2 Enterprise Integration

üè¢ CRM Deep Integration

Salesforce Native App Development

Embed the scraping application as a managed Salesforce package for seamless account, lead, and contact enrichment.

Automate direct pipeline updates with Apex triggers and Lightning Web Components (LWC) bridging to scraped business intelligence data.

Enable real-time push of validated and deduplicated contact data into Salesforce objects, aligning with enterprise governance.

HubSpot Marketplace Integration

Publish a connector app on the HubSpot marketplace with OAuth2-based authentication.

Auto-sync scraped business data into HubSpot CRM pipelines, lists, and workflows.

Provide bi-directional updates so that changes in HubSpot reflect in discovery insights dashboards (React-based UI).

Pipedrive Connector

Deliver a TypeScript-based integration for managing scraped leads in Pipedrive deals and contacts.

Leverage Puppeteer scrapers to auto-refresh company profiles in Pipedrive using scheduled jobs.

Enable analytics-driven prioritization of scraped leads directly in Pipedrive dashboards.

Custom CRM API Adapters

Develop modular adapters for any REST/GraphQL CRM endpoints using the Next.js API routes layer.

Support role-based access and per-CRM mapping of data models (e.g., company, lead, contact).

Include real-time validation middleware to prevent duplicate or stale entries across CRMs.

‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Infrastructure

AWS/Azure Deployment Options

Deploy scalable front-end (Next.js/React) via AWS Amplify or Azure Static Web Apps.

Run Puppeteer-based scrapers in containerized ECS/EKS (AWS) or AKS (Azure) clusters.

Centralize orchestration with serverless task scheduling (AWS Lambda/Azure Functions).

Scalable Microservices Architecture

Separate scraping, validation, enrichment, and CRM-sync pipelines into TypeScript-driven microservices.

Enable async communication with message queues (SQS, Service Bus, Kafka) for high throughput.

Provide internal GraphQL gateway for unified data access.

Database Clustering & Replication

Host structured lead/contact data in PostgreSQL with read replicas for performance.

Store raw scraped content in NoSQL (MongoDB/DynamoDB) for flexible querying.

Ensure multi-region replication for reliability and compliance.

Global CDN for Performance

Deliver discovery dashboards and analytics via Vercel Edge CDN or CloudFront.

Use incremental static regeneration (ISR) in Next.js for cached, SEO-optimized pages.

Implement edge caching with stale-while-revalidate (SWR) to ensure fresh yet performant results."
