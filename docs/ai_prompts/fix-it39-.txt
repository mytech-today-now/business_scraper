Edge Cases & Error Scenarios

                
Edge Case Testing PromptCopy

Implement comprehensive edge case and error scenario testing for the business_scraper application. I need you to:

1. Create test suites for boundary conditions and edge cases
2. Test error handling and recovery mechanisms
3. Implement chaos engineering scenarios for resilience testing
4. Test data corruption and recovery scenarios
5. Cover network failures and external service outages

Edge cases to test:
- Empty datasets and null value handling
- Maximum input sizes and rate limits
- Network timeouts and connection failures
- Database connection issues and recovery
- External API failures and fallback mechanisms

Error scenarios to test:
- Invalid authentication tokens and expired sessions
- Malformed request payloads and injection attempts
- Resource exhaustion and memory pressure
- Concurrent access and race conditions
- Data consistency and transaction rollbacks

Ensure all error conditions are handled gracefully with appropriate user feedback and system recovery.
