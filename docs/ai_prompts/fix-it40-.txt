Coverage Verification & Reporting

                
Coverage Verification PromptCopy

Implement comprehensive coverage verification and reporting for the business_scraper application. I need you to:

1. Create automated coverage verification scripts
2. Generate detailed coverage reports by module and priority
3. Implement coverage gates for CI/CD pipeline integration
4. Create visual coverage dashboards and trend analysis
5. Verify achievement of 98% overall coverage target

Coverage verification tasks:
- Run comprehensive test suite and generate coverage reports
- Verify P0 modules achieve 100% coverage (security, payments)
- Verify P1 modules achieve 95% coverage (APIs, business logic)
- Verify P2 modules achieve 85% coverage (UI components)
- Generate trend reports showing coverage improvement over time

Create coverage gates that:
- Prevent deployment if coverage drops below thresholds
- Require manual approval for coverage regressions
- Generate alerts for uncovered critical code paths
- Integrate with GitHub Actions for automated reporting

Document all coverage metrics and provide actionable recommendations for maintaining high coverage standards.
