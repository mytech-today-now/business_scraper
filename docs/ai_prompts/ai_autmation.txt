Implement the following enhancement to the application.  Do the enhancement first.  Follow the Rules and Guidelines for the project.  Plan out you actions.  Work logically through the process.  Be sure to cover all of the instances where the enhancement alters the application.  Handle errors and fallback to seamless solutions.

"üéØ Phase 2: AI & Automation (v1.10.0)

This phase upgrades the application from raw business discovery into a system that delivers intelligent prioritization, predictive insights, and real-time enrichment. Built on Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Puppeteer, the system leverages automation, scraping pipelines, and AI-driven scoring to provide business intelligence at scale.

2.1 Intelligent Lead Scoring
ü§ñ AI-Powered Lead Quality Assessment

TypeScript ML Integration for Lead Scoring

Implement lightweight ML models in Node.js (e.g., TensorFlow.js or ONNX runtime) to rank leads discovered by Puppeteer crawlers.

Score leads using scraped features such as domain authority, employee count indicators, website content relevance, and presence of calls-to-action.

Integrate retraining workflows where models learn continuously from user feedback stored in a Postgres or MongoDB database.

Website Quality Analysis (Design, Content, Functionality)

Puppeteer scraping modules extract HTML, CSS, and JS signals.

Automated audits using Lighthouse APIs for performance, accessibility, and SEO.

NLP pipelines (running via Node.js + HuggingFace models served over REST) analyze text for professionalism, tone, and keyword alignment.

Output: A Website Health Score that feeds directly into the lead score pipeline.

Business Maturity Indicators

Scraping modules (Puppeteer + API integrations) pull metadata such as:

Presence of careers/jobs page (implies growth).

Funding mentions, press releases, or investor relations pages.

Structured signals from LinkedIn or Crunchbase APIs.

Each maturity signal is stored in the app‚Äôs Next.js backend and surfaced as part of the lead profile.

Conversion Probability Prediction

Implement probability scoring (logistic regression or gradient boosting converted to JS runtime).

Provide a confidence-weighted likelihood (e.g., ‚Äú72% ¬± 6%‚Äù) directly inside the React-based lead dashboard.

Expose model predictions via an internal /api/score route in Next.js.

üìà Predictive Analytics

Best Contact Time Prediction

Analyze engagement metadata from collected datasets (email open times, form responses, LinkedIn activity).

Use time-series forecasting (Prophet or LSTM served via Node bindings) to suggest the best outreach window.

Display recommendations in React UI (e.g., ‚ÄúTuesday 10‚Äì11 AM local time‚Äù).

Response Rate Forecasting

Classify leads based on historical communication data (stored in your DB).

Use response patterns to generate outreach strategy recommendations (cold email vs. LinkedIn vs. phone).

Integrate into the Next.js dashboard as adaptive tooltips or side-panel insights.

Industry Trend Analysis

Puppeteer scrapers continuously pull industry-specific news, blogs, and competitor websites.

NLP summarizers (TypeScript + HuggingFace REST services) detect emerging themes, trending keywords, and risk alerts.

Expose this as an ‚ÄúIndustry Insights‚Äù dashboard in React with tag clouds, timeline graphs, and sentiment indicators.

Seasonal Business Pattern Detection

Use time-series models (ARIMA/Prophet via Node services) to detect seasonal fluctuations in business activity across leads.

Automate quarterly or monthly pattern reports and embed them in the React interface.

Example insight: ‚ÄúConversion rates historically spike in April for construction businesses in Midwest U.S.‚Äù

‚úÖ Developer Notes for Next.js + Puppeteer + TypeScript Integration

Scraping Layer: Puppeteer orchestrates headless Chrome sessions, storing structured data in JSON/DB for ML pipelines.

ML/AI Layer: Use TensorFlow.js or run Python models as microservices (FastAPI/Flask) called via Next.js API routes.

Data Validation: TypeScript strict typing ensures lead data consistency before scoring.

UI/UX: React components display AI-driven insights (scores, charts, recommendations) in real time.

Automation: Cron jobs in Next.js (via serverless functions or background workers) handle scheduled scraping, retraining, and forecasting.

Extensibility: Designed so new AI modules (e.g., workflow automation, competitor benchmarking) can be plugged into the existing Next.js API routes without disrupting existing pipelines."

After the enhancement is complete, refactor all of the markdown files in '/docs/' to either be deleted or brought up to date as a refactored and renamed HTML file of the up-to-date content.  All of the HTML files will share an external CSS file in the /docs/ folder.

After this is complete, refactor '/docs/readme.md' into an HTML file, with the same external CSS file link.  The readme.html will contain a lengthy explination of each file contained within the /docs/ folder with a relative link to the appropriate HTML file.

The goal with the /docs/ work is to create material that users can access to understand the application better.

Be sure not to process any markdown files that have secrets in them.  No Keys.
