Testing Infrastructure Coverage Gaps P1 - High Priority
Issue Overview
Problem: Testing infrastructure has significant gaps despite 85% overall coverage, with critical areas under-tested.

📍 Location
jest.config.js - Test coverage thresholds

src/tests/integration/ - Integration tests with 37 failing tests

src/tests/e2e/ - E2E tests requiring SSR fixes

src/tests/security/ - Security testing requiring SNYK_TOKEN

src/tests/performance/ - Performance testing framework

🔍 Current State
85% coverage with gaps in critical paths and edge cases

🚨 Testing Gaps Identified
Integration tests: 37 failing tests requiring fixes
E2E tests: SSR fixes needed for full functionality
Security testing: SNYK_TOKEN configuration required
Performance testing: Framework needs optimization
💥 Impact
Production bugs due to insufficient regression testing
Security vulnerabilities going undetected
Performance regressions not caught early
Critical user workflows under-tested
Edge cases and error scenarios missed
Integration points between services failing
AI Diagnostic Prompts
🔍 Integration Test Failure Analysis
Analyze the 37 failing integration tests in src/tests/integration/ and identify root causes:

1. **API Route Import Failures**: Check for missing function imports (enhancedScrapePost, dataManagementPost)
2. **NextRequest Mock Issues**: Resolve NextRequest mock incompatibility with Next.js 14
3. **TensorFlow Model Failures**: Fix AI/ML test initialization issues
4. **Azure Integration Problems**: Address API endpoint mismatches and credential handling
5. **CRM Export Service Issues**: Fix Blob API mocking and validation logic errors
6. **Missing Dependencies**: Install @testing-library/dom and other missing packages
7. **Jest Configuration Conflicts**: Resolve MockRequest class conflicts with NextRequest

Generate a comprehensive fix plan with specific file locations and code changes needed.
🌐 E2E Test SSR Compatibility Fix
Fix SSR compatibility issues preventing E2E tests from running:

1. **useResponsive Hook**: Add typeof window !== 'undefined' checks in src/hooks/useResponsive.ts:104
2. **SearchEngineManager**: Fix localStorage access in src/lib/searchEngineManager.ts:202
3. **CRMTemplateManager**: Add browser environment checks for localStorage usage
4. **Browser API Safety**: Implement safe access patterns for window, navigator, localStorage
5. **SSR Guards**: Add comprehensive SSR compatibility checks across all client-side code
6. **Test Server Startup**: Ensure application starts successfully for E2E testing

Create robust SSR-safe implementations that work in both server and client environments.
🔒 Security Testing Enhancement
Enhance security testing infrastructure and configure SNYK_TOKEN:

1. **SNYK Integration**: Configure SNYK_TOKEN in environment variables and CI/CD
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Set up automated dependency vulnerability scanning

4. **Penetration Testing**: Implement automated penetration testing scenarios
5. **CSRF/XSS Protection**: Enhance CSRF and XSS protection testing
6. **Authentication Security**: Strengthen authentication and session security tests
7. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Expand SQL injection prevention testing

Implement comprehensive security testing that catches vulnerabilities before production.
⚡ Performance Testing Framework Optimization
Optimize the performance testing framework for better coverage:

1. **Load Testing Enhancement**: Improve load testing scenarios in src/tests/performance/loadTesting.test.ts
2. **Memory Leak Detection**: Enhance memory leak detection and monitoring
3. **Performance Regression**: Strengthen performance regression testing
4. **Core Web Vitals**: Implement comprehensive Core Web Vitals monitoring

3. **Integration Point Testing**: Test all service integration points thoroughly
4. **Error Handling Coverage**: Ensure all error handling paths are tested
5. **Boundary Condition Testing**: Test all boundary conditions and limits
6. **Concurrent Operation Testing**: Test concurrent operations and race conditions
7. **Fallback Mechanism Testing**: Test all fallback and recovery mechanisms

Achieve 95%+ meaningful test coverage across all critical application areas.
Implementation Guidelines
// Example SSR-safe implementation pattern function useSafeLocalStorage(key: string, defaultValue: any) { const [value, setValue] = useState(() => { if (typeof window === 'undefined') { return defaultValue } try { const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key) return item ? JSON.parse(item) : defaultValue } catch (error) { console.warn(`Error reading localStorage key "${key}":`, error) return defaultValue } }) const setStoredValue = useCallback((newValue: any) => { try { setValue(newValue) if (typeof window !== 'undefined') { window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(newValue)) } } catch (error) { console.warn(`Error setting localStorage key "${key}":`, error) } }, [key]) return [value, setStoredValue] }
