- **Result**: System defaults to comprehensive gathering

#### 🔧 UI Components (AdvancedResultsDashboard.tsx, ApiConfigurationPage.tsx)

2. Process 1 page → Move to next criteria
3. Stop at 50 results → Incomplete coverage
```

#### New Flow (Comprehensive)
```
1. Search "test" industry → Query: "CPA firm" (from keywords)
2. Process 6 pages → Complete coverage per criteria
3. Continue until all criteria processed → Maximum results
```
