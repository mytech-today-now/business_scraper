## [6.10.1] - 2025-09-27

### Security

#### CRITICAL: Environment Variable Exposure Fix (Issue #225)

- **Fixed critical security vulnerability** where sensitive environment variables were exposed in the client-side bundle through `next.config.js`
- **Removed sensitive variables** from client bundle including:
  - `DATABASE_URL`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (database credentials)
  - `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD_SALT` (admin credentials)
  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (payment secrets)
  - All database connection details (`DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`)
- **Maintained safe client-side variables**:
  - `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (public by design)
  - `PAYMENT_SUCCESS_URL`, `PAYMENT_CANCEL_URL` (URLs, not secrets)
  - `ENABLE_AUTH`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG` (configuration flags)
  - Build-time configuration flags
- **Impact**: Prevents complete compromise of database, admin access, and payment system
- **CVSS Score**: 9.8 (Critical) - Trivial exploitability via browser developer tools
- **Compliance**: Addresses PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC 2 compliance violations

### Changed

- Updated `next.config.js` to only expose safe, client-side environment variables
- Server-side secrets now accessed exclusively via `process.env` in server components and API routes
